NOTE: ATTRACT 2.0 is still UNDER DEVELOPMENT 
This installation instruction is still in the DRAFT stage
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ATTRACT is developed under Linux. It should work under Mac OSX, but this has not been tested. 
It does not work under Microsoft Windows.

Installation instructions for Linux:

1. Install g++ and gfortran (under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install g++ gfortran).
For CUDA support install the CUDA toolkit. For more information visit "https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit".
In addition install the boost coroutine library version 1.54.0 (under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libboost-coroutine1.54-dev).
Go into "attract/bin", "make all" or "make all -j4" (if you have 4 cores)

2. Export the ATTRACT environment variables. In your .bashrc file, add the following:
  export ATTRACTDIR=/home/user/attract/bin (i.e. wherever you installed attract)
  export ATTRACTTOOLS=$ATTRACTDIR/../tools
  export ATTRACTGUI=$ATTRACTDIR/../gui
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ATTRACTDIR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3. For the analysis, also install numpy and scipy (under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy)

4. For iATTRACT and the OPLSX forcefield, install pdb2pqr (under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install pdb2pqr)
In addition, the pdb2pqr directory must be made accessible to Python. (Under Ubuntu, this directory is
/usr/share/pdb2pqr . It should contain the files "pdb2pqr.py" and "main.py".)
To make it accessible, edit your .bashrc file (/home/user/.bashrc) by adding the following
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/share/pdb2pqr  

5. Test your installation.
Type "source ~/.bashrc" (or start a new command line shell).
After step 1 and 2, typing "$ATTRACTDIR/attract" should result in:
  Too few arguments
  usage: $path/attract structures.dat parameterfile receptor.pdb [ligand.pdb] [options]
After step 3, typing "python -c 'import numpy, scipy' " should give no error.
After step 4, typing "python -c 'import pdb2pqr' " should give no error.
